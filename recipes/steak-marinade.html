    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize 
        the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks 
        can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and, 
        with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade.
         Budget-friendly steaks, however, benefit tremendously from marination. 
         You'll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes!</p>
